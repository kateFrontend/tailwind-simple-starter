# Tailwind CSS Simple Starter

![cover](./assets/tailwind.png)

Tailwind is a CSS framework that provides us with single-purpose utility classes which are opinionated for the most part, and which help us design our web pages from right inside our markup or .js 

Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.

This is a simple setup to develop Tailwind projects, which will be used for Tailwind projects.
